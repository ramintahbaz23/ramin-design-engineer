And in many cases, they disappeared." },

  { type: 'text' as const, content: "To the workers of 1961, this moment felt unprecedented. Computers were genuinely new. There was no playbook, no established pattern for how to integrate machines that could perform cognitive work. The complexity was real, both technical and social. The fear was rational." },
  { type: 'text' as const, content: "And yet, looking back, we can see it wasn't the first time. The industrial revolution introduced machines that replaced physical labor. The telegraph compressed time and distance in ways that felt destabilizing. Each wave of automation sparked the same questions: What happens to human work? What gets lost?

The people building them see possibility. The people living alongside them see uncertainty. And for a period, sometimes brief, sometimes generational, there is friction.' },
  { type: 'text' as const, content: "Eventually, the technology becomes normalized. Not because the anxiety was irrational, but because society adapts. New roles emerge. Systems become more predictable. The thing that once felt incomprehensible becomes mundane." },
  { type: 'text' as const, content: "Today, we are at the beginning of another cycle. Artificial intelligence and robotics are no longer confined to labs or industrial settings. They are moving into homes, workplaces, and public spaces. And once again, the dominant conversation is about displacement. Will machines replace workers? Will they remove agency? Will they make human roles obsolete?" },

  { type: 'text' as const, content: `Personal computers followed the same curve. By the 1970s, computing had been around for decades, but the machines were still basement-dwelling mainframes that most people never interacted with. "There is no reason anyone would want a computer in their home," said the CEO of Digital Equipment Corporation in 1977. Within fifteen years, personal computers were standard.` },

By 2005, he predicted, the phrase "information economy" would sound silly. That was written just as the internet was beginning to reshape nearly every sector of the economy.` },

  { type: 'text' as const, content: `A technology can work in a lab, or even in controlled deployment, and still take years to become embedded in daily life. Systems need to be built around it. Regulations need to adapt. People need to learn new behaviors. Industries need to reorganize. All of this takes time. More time than the initial excitement accounts for.` },

But translating those capabilities into widespread, reliable, economically transformative applications has been slower than predicted.` },
